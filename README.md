# WolframOptimalRotate
Rotate a 3D object to best display its shape and features.

ResourceFunction["OptimalRotate"] accepts three-dimensional graphics objects in Graphics3D and MeshRegion.

The more points on the rotational path, the clearer the animation will be for visualizing the shape and features of the object.

n must be a positive integer.

By increasing the number of rotational points, you can alter object rotations to be clearer with details
